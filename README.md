## Summary

#### A shortlist of challenges we aim to solve for Rainforest Retail:
- As more employees are added it becomes harder to get an overview of availability and where everyone is working on a given day
- Keeping employee records up to date is time-consuming and error-prone


Rainforest Retail needs tailored solutions to improve the recording and maintenance of employee availability. The current use of paper records within the business requires too many resources and is unproductive. By combining all the physical diaries to be placed on a digital platform we could reduce the number of conflicts and improve overall employee productivity.



#### What makes us different?


We aim to make paper records a thing of the past. Our system specifically identifies the gaps in the data of Rainforest Retail and helps the process of organisation to make things easier for the head office down to the warehouse worker.

## Accessibility

Our team TimeTrackers ‚è∞ care about accessibility and have implemented aria-label attribute for screen readers in this application. We have also planned for Dyslexia-friendly mode to increase webpage legibility for users with learning disorders like dyslexia. It not only helps those with said disorders, but also users who prefer visual modifications for easier reading. We hope to implement this and more in the future!
